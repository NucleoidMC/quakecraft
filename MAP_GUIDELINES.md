# Quakecraft Map Guidelines

This document describes some guidelines for map-making to ensure a great experience.

## Avoid very narrow inside-space

Pay extra attention to the playable space, smaller it is, the more claustrophobic it will be, and it will become hard to play.  
That is a criticism you can find in some maps in Team Fortress 2 for example, where players will dislike very narrow spaces, choke points,
as those become very hard to fairly fight against other players.  
This can be mitigated by avoiding very long small corridors, 
and by making larger spaces and using "props" to create hiding points instead.
